The book Escaping the Build Trap by Melissa Perri describes why product development efforts often fail and what needs to happen for organizations to become product-led. The book is one of the best overall descriptions of how a product-led organization should function and what the role of a product manager should be in such an organization.

### Book Summary
Build trap is a term Perri uses to describe a situation where an organization is stuck measuring success by the number of features or products delivered, rather than by the business outcomes those features and products result in. 

Escaping the build trap is important to stay competitive. An output focused company will end-up developing features that don't solve customer problems and as customers are not willing to pay for such features. Perri describes how a company can get out of the build trap and become a product-led organization that optimizes for customer value.

#### What does a company in a build trap look like?

Budgeting, strategy work and product roadmaps are set on a yearly cycle. The company sees product strategy as a plan that lists what steps to take and what features or products to build. The feature list is passed down in the organization to the product teams that have the features as their goals.

Product managers are measured by how well they are able to deliver the outputs, and not by what kind of business outcomes those outputs bring. As the PMs goal is to ship a certain set of features by a certain deadline, they are not incentivized to question whether building those specific features make sense. With output focused success metrics, user research is seemingly unproductive as the discovery work just slows down the development work. 

As user research is neglected, the teams end up developing features that no one needs or wants, and that don't deliver business outcomes.

The top management sees no movement in the business metrics and conclude that the product teams are failing. They come up with new features to build in order to fix the situation, and the process repeats itself again.

#### What does a  product-led company look like?
Making the switch from an output focused feature factory to a product-led company requires changes in the way strategy is set, how product management is seen and how product development investments are seen.

##### Strategy 
Strategy in a product-led company is deployed in four layers: 
1. **Vision** of where the company wants to be in in the next few years
2. **Strategic intents** highlighting most important obstacles between where the company is now and its vision
3. **Initiatives** are the approaches that are taken to remove the obstacles
4. **Options** are the things the product teams will experiment with to reach the initiatives.

Strategy should form a framework for product leaders and managers to help them decide what to focus on, and what initiatives to take and features to build.

The strategy should be based on analysis that answers the following questions: 
* Where is the company now?
* Where does the company want to be?
* What are the most important obstacles to remove in order to take the company closer to its goals?
The list of obstacles to remove should be kept short to make sure the company is focused and aligned.

When the obstacles are removed or the operating environment changes, strategy is adjusted to reflect the new situation. 

Product development initiatives are seen as bets. Thinking of the initiatives as bets acknowledges that the initiatives are risky by nature. The more sure you are of the outcome of the outcome, that is, the less risky the initiative is, the larger bets you can make.

The job of the product manager is to reduce the risks related to the bets by doing user research. Risks are also mitigated by experimentation - making smaller experimental investments before committing to building the full-blown feature or product, and validating those experiments with the customers. 

Product manager, together with the product team, come up with options that the team can build to 

##### The Product Management Process

Perri introduces a process she calls the Product Kata, a version of the Toyota Kata adjusted to the software development world. Product Kata is a process for continuous development and learning where the product team where the team tackels

The team selects a goal that describes that is aligned with the strategic intent, and determines what the target metric should be when the goal is fulfilled. 
The Product Kata is a five step process that is repeated until the goal is reached:
1. Where are we now with our goal?
2. What is the next obstacle preventing us from reaching the goal? These should be small enough to accomplish in a weeks time 
3. What step/action can we take to tackle the obstacle?
4. What is the expected outcome of the action?
5. What was the actual outcome and what can we learn from this?

It's noteworthy that the iterations don't necessarily start with building something. In the first cycles the biggest obstacle might be e.g. lack of product metrics about the phenomenon, and the step to take is to add user tracking to the product. After learning about the user behavior through metrics, the next obstacle might be to understand why users are behaving that way, and the steps to take would be to interview target customers. After these initial discovery steps, one can start building the solution.

The Product Kata is basically the same process that Perri suggest for strategy creation, but applied on a lower organizational level. Product leaders can use it as a coaching tool to help product managers run experiments systematically and efficiently.

### My Impressions

I believe that one major force keeping companies in the build trap is that an output focused organization feels productive. Everyone is busy developing stuff, features are shipped regularly, and the teams are meeting their (output) goals. The problem obviously is that the goals are set wrongly and the things the teams ship donâ€™t produce customer value. Stepping out of the trap would require a leap of faith from the whole leadership team. The organization would need to slow down on feature development and go into discovery mode to catch up on the research. For a leadership team used to output focused success metrics, this slowing down of feature development will look like the development teams would be losing momentum.

Another force keeping development organizations in the build trap that Perri only briefly touched in the book is the cooperation between product and sales. Salespeople have their quota tied to the sales budgets, and to set the budget, the sales leadership need a product roadmap with sellable features and their release dates. This roadmapping exercise and the commitments it bring pushes the development team towards an output focused, waterfallish working style where shipping in time is a top priority. Solving this puzzle requires a lot of communication, and Perri suggests having a sales roadmap separate from an internal roadmap.

The book assumes a buy-in from the leadership team before any change can happen. I believe that in many traditional companies that are not product-led by nature, more demand for escaping the build trap exists among the product managers. An interesting question left unanswered would be how could a product lead or a similar middle-manager start the transformation process without a strong buy-in from top-management. 

It would most likely require the product lead to push back on the feature wishlists coming from the top, and providing air-cover for the product managers the lead is managing to give them space to do the user research needed. It would most likely take several development cycles before the necessary knowledge would be accumulated and the product teams could start making informed roadmap suggestions to the leadership team. 

Overall, I think Escaping the Build Trap is the best book I've read about how to build a product-led organization. Perri has managed to nail down a very real phenomenon affecting many product development organizations.

### Top quotes
#### Build trap
>A build trap is when organizations become stuck measuring their success by outputs rather than outcomes. It's when they focus more on shipping and delivering features rather than on the actual value those things produce.

#### Outputs vs. Outcomes
>Outputs are easily quantifiable things that we produce - number of products or features, number of releases or velocity of the development teams. Outcomes are the things that result when we finally deliver those features and the customer problems are solved

#### The Role of the Product Manager
>The real role of the product manager in the organization is to work with a team to create the right product that balances meeting business needs with solving user problems.

#### Strategy
>Strategy is about how you take the organization from where you currently are and reach the vision. For strategy to be created, you must first understand the vision, or where you want to go. Then we can identify problems or obstacles standing in our way of getting there and experiment around tackling them. We repeatedly do this until we reach the vision.
