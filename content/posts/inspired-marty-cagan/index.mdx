## Book summary

Inspired is one of the most well-known product management books. It is mentioned everytime someone is looking for a handbook in the tech product management.

### Project with the average product development process
According to Cagan, in the average company, products are developed in a waterfall fashion. 
1. Ideas are generated somewhere inside the company
2. A product manager creates a business case for the idea
3. The idea is put on a roadmap and product requirements are written for idea.
4. A designer takes the requirements into a solution concept
5. The developers build the feature and QA checks that it is built according to specifications
6. The product is released

Typically the release is a failure since 
- The ideas and the solution concepts are validated only after the release when the big investments have already been made.
- The waterfall process also turns the team's focus to outputs - getting the feature out there - and not on the outcomes - creating something that the customers would find valuable. 

Focusing on outputs turns product managers into project managers that take requirements and produce documentation for the developers. The developer's role is to take orders and deliver features - not to think about the customers and innovate. 

### Continuous discovery and continuous delivery

Cagan suggests adopting lean and agile methodologies instead where
1. Ideas are validated before development starts, and big risks are identified and mitigated early on. 
2. Product, design and development work side-by-side so that everyone in the development team is thinking about the actual customer problems.
3. The focus in on solving problems and delivering business outcomes, not on delivering specific features.

For the product manager, this means shifting focus from taking requirements and turning them into specs to discovering what the customer's problems are and collaborating with the development team to find solutions to them. 

Cagan advocates a parallel process where continuous discovery and continuous delivery processes run side-by-side. Discovery should focus on validating the key risks:
- value risk - customers find the product valuable enough to pay for it
- usability risk - users understand how to use the product
- feasibility risk - engineers can build it
- business viability risk - the solution fits the business model, the sales incentives, the legal can accept it etc.

Overall the book gives a good overview of what tech product management in an agile environment should be about.
