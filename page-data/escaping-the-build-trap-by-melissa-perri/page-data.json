Everyone is busy developing stuff, features are shipped regularly, and the teams are meeting their (output) goals. The problem obviously is that the goals are set wrongly and the things the teams ship don\\u2019t produce customer value. Stepping out of the trap would require a leap of faith from the whole leadership team. The organization would need to slow down on feature development and go into discovery mode to catch up on the research. For a leadership team used to output focused success metrics, this slowing down of feature development will look like the development teams would be losing momentum.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Another force keeping development organizations in the build trap that Perri only briefly touched in the book is the cooperation between product and sales. Salespeople have their quota tied to the sales budgets, and to set the budget, the sales leadership need a product roadmap with sellable features and their release dates. This roadmapping exercise and the commitments it bring pushes the development team towards an output focused, waterfallish working style where shipping in time is a top priority. Solving this puzzle requires a lot of communication, and Perri suggests having a sales roadmap separate from an internal roadmap.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The book assumes a buy-in from the leadership team before any change can happen. I believe that in many traditional companies that are not product-led by nature, more demand for escaping the build trap exists among the product managers. An interesting question left unanswered would be how could a product lead or a similar middle-manager start the transformation process without a strong buy-in from top-management. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It would most likely require the product lead to push back on the feature wishlists coming from the top, and providing air-cover for the product managers the lead is managing to give them space to do the user research needed. It would most likely take several development cycles before the necessary knowledge would be accumulated and the product teams could start making informed roadmap suggestions to the leadership team. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Overall, I think Escaping the Build Trap is the best book I've read about how to build a product-led organization.
