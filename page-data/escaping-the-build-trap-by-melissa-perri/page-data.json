This pushes the development team towards an output focused working style where shipping in time is a top priority. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The book assumes a buy-in from the leadership team before any change can happen. I believe that in many  companies that are not product-led, more demand for escaping the build trap exists among the product managers than the senior management team.
