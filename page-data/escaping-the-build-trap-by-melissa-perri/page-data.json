An interesting question left unanswered is, could a the trasformation be done starting from the bottom, without a strong (initial) buy-in from top-management.

The strategy section is aligned with what the book Good Strategy/Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt, and the description of the role of a product manager is pretty much what is described in Inspired by Marty Cagan. Perri manages to bridge the ideas in these different books, bring her own ideas to the mix and give an overview of how a product-led organization should function.
